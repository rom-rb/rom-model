This is a set of extensions for PORO objects to help in data coercion and validation.
It was extracted from rom-rails and for now it uses Virtus and ActiveModel.

The package includes:

- `ROM::Attributes` for defining input attributes with types and coercion rules
- `ROM::Validator` a standalone validator object extension built on top of
  `ActiveModel::Validations` with additional features like nested validators

## The Planâ„¢

This gem is built on top of existing 3rd party gems that have proven to be stable
and good-enough. Unfortunately neither Virtus nor ActiveModel do not meet certain
design requirements to be a good fit in the long term.

For that reason we're exploring how to build a better foundation for rom-model.
Specifically following initiatives are taking place:

- Exploring a lower-level validation library with great composability features
  and simple interface
- Investigating a lower-level input data sanitization/coercion library that would
  be a perfect fit for handling web forms and json input

Furthermore rom-model will be soon extended with a third extension for defining
[Algebraic Data Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) which
will work remarkably well with [rom-repository](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom-repository)
and its auto-mapping features.

This project will provide convenient interfaces on top of robust lower-level tools
and if it turns out to be too big we'll split it into smaller gems.
